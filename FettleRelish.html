                <h1>About The Project</h1>
                <p>There is a misconception around eating healthy or eating clean. These ‘healthy’ and ‘clean’ meals are often considered boring, bland, complicated to make and tasteless.
                </p>
               <br>
                <h3>PROBLEM</h3>
                <p>During these tough pandemic times, everyone is aware of the importance of developing a robust immune system and healthy lifestyle. Amidst the busy working schedule and no limitations to new work from home lifestyle, consumption of readily available and ready to eat/fast food meals has become the new lifestyle. This new way of living has taken a toll on health and our natural defence system. But, what is stopping us from taking control of our own lives is this deception about healthy diets and our busy lifestyles.

                    Here, Fettle Relish recipe app proves that including a healthy diet to one’s lifestyle isn’t as boring and complicated as perceived, but it’s just the opposite!

            <ul>
                <li><p>This project began with the idea of just creating a recipe app with simple ingredients & easily understandable recipes.</p></li><br>
                <li><p>As I proceeded, I looked into some of the existing apps in the market and conducted some user researches. From these researches I found out that, most of the users are not keen on joining or downloading any recipe apps. All the required recipes and their making were easily available on YouTube. That’s when I realised that a solid goal or motivation is required for drawing any users to my app.</p></li><br>
                <li><p>
                    Considering the present situation, where pandemic has shown the world how important it is to have a strong immune system, I decided to create an app which focuses and forces people to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make them change their habit of bingeing on fast foods.

                <p>The users I chose represents my target audience; Working adults. Though the troubles of having to maintain their health and well-being amidst their busy schedules and workloads is common to all, the difference in their personality and perspective is what I could use to build a better usable app.</p>

                <p>User would be educated about the benefits of healthy and wholesome eating. The misconception and deceptive image of healthy diets being bland, less and out of the routine thing will be proven wrong with this app. Healthy meals can be tasty and interesting. With a consistent following of recipes from this app, the cravings and desire for processed and high sugar foods will diminish to zero.</p>

            <h1>Usability Testing</h1>
            <br>
            <p>After prototyping, my target users and some of slack community members were given the link to test the flow and navigations of the design.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Reviewing & Critiquing</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Users who tested the prototype found it logical and detailed. Some have even expressed their desire to use the app for real.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>“ I like the shades of gray with the cool green color and light background color - It gives the screens a clean, fresh feel. On the smallest/mobile screen the back button at the top is quite large, maybe you could make this smaller it distracts from the image. I think you’ve done well with your typography and hierarchy - it’s clear and easy to understand. Last I really like the idea that you have included a converter for imperial to metric. As an American in New Zealand that would be great to have when looking at recipes. Cheers!’
                - Esteban Garcia ( Slack community member)
                </h6>
             <br>
             <h6>“ Beautiful colour palette that complements the delicious looking images. I love the rating at the top and the ability to like, save or add; something I do when I see something I want to explore more but don’t have time just then. The soft shadows for the call to action makes me see what the next steps are. User reviews also a great way to assess the product. Very happy to see the total calories on the top right and time taken, important for me when deciding what to eat/cook. I assume the up and down arrows with the serves selector will change the ingredient amount, clever! My one concern is the share icons may be a bit hard to select on the mobile screen with your finger. The stacking of measurement selector in the gray box made the text legible at small size. The layout is clear, uncluttered and elegant. Congrats.” - Monica Lindin ( Slack community member)

            <br>
            <p>The UI design process started with ‘Mobile First’ approach. All designs were first hand sketched for the mobile version of this app, which was later made responsive by determining the breakpoints and sketching for larger devices. The designs for all screen sizes were tested during wireframing.</p><br>

                            <p>SWOT analysis and research on the existing app gave me an idea of how a recipe app should look and function as I have never used one before. Secondly, I loved the sketching and protyping phase. Being a person who likes to draw, sketching the wireframes was the best part of the project for me.</p>

                            <p>Planning my user interviews and scheduling time didn’t go so well for me as the users I chose for this app were an exact representation of my target audience; Working Adults. To take out some time from their busy schedule turned out to be troublesome to me. Apart from this, a lot of time was spent on defining a proper user flow.</p><br>
